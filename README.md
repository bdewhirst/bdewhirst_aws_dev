Personal AWS Development ~~Environment~~

## purpose
Most of my cloud computing experience to date has been on Google Cloud Platforms.

As AWS has greater market penetration, I'm investigating it.

This is public, but very informal-- it is largely learning-in-progress with some transparency. 

(If you're looking for resources, AWS has good documentation and tutorials. Think of that as the textbook, and this as class notes.)

## status
Work in progress as of 2022-08-16.

It is looking like any aws-dedicated python would be in another personal repo or one of AWS's code repository services.

## misc

As detailed in docs/doc.md, I installed the relevant AWS IDE for PyCharm and confirmed it worked.

The "secrets" folder of this project will only store files locally (_i.e._ not in git). 
Certain configuration files for AWS integration are in the virtual environment associated with this PyCharm project, and those are also local.

When it doesn't make sense to track files created here in git (e.g., a ~300 MB cdk demo), these will be added to .gitignore.
